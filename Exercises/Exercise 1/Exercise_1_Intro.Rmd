## Preparation

Please work through the [Prerequisites
section](https://github.com/josefinjohannsen/Wellbeing_SoSe2024/blob/main/README.md#0-prerequisites)
to be prepared for the first exercise.

## What is R?

R is a free software environment for statistical analysis.

### Graphical User Interface

Your opened RStudio should look something like the following:

<img src="RStudio_GUI.png" width="960" height="525/"/>

The RStudio GUI consists of several areas. In the console area, R code
can be entered, which is then interpreted (executed) by R. The `>`
character is the R prompt (prompt character).

In the upper right corner, besides the History, which lists all the
commands you have executed so far, we find the Environment section.
There you will find all the variables, data sets and functions that have
been defined.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

| Command   | Meaning                                   | Example (if appropriate) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|

| !         | Logical NOT   | !x                         |
| xor(x, y) | Exclusive OR  | Either in x or y, not both |

The following graphic shows the use of the logical operators by means of
Venn diagrams. `x` always refers to the left circle, `y` to the right.

## R Functions

In the following we will look at some of the standard R functions that
can be used and that make up the language in the first place. Each
function can be called in the documentation (even if it was inserted via
a library - more to that later). Just call the command `help(fct-name)`
or `?fct` (just type it into the console). There you get a first
overview about the function and its parameters.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
help(round)

?round
```

### Numerical Functions

| Command              | Meaning              | Example (if appropriate)         |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| abs(x)               | Absolute Value       |                                  |
| sqrt(x)              | Square root          |                                  |
| ceiling(x)           | Round Up             | ceiling(4.687) is 5              |
| floor(x)             | Round Off            | floor(4.687) is 4                |
| round(x, digits = n) | Rounding             | round(4.687, digits = 2) is 4.69 |
| log(x)               | Natural Logarithm    |                                  |
| log2(x)              | Logarithm to base 2  |                                  |
| log10(x)             | Logarithm to base 10 |                                  |
| exp(x)               | Exponential Function | e^x                              |

### Statistical Functions

These functions all have the argument `na.rm`, which by default takes
the value `FALSE`. This allows missing values to be taken into account,
i.e., missing values (na = not available) are not removed in this case
(rm = remove). These functions can all be applied to a vector (see
below).

| Command                | Meaning                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| mean(x, na.rm = FALSE) | Mean Value                                        |
| sd(x)                  | Standard Deviation                                |
| var(x)                 | Variance                                          |
| median(x)              | Median                                            |
| quantile(x, probs)     | Quantiles of X (probs: Vector with Probabilities) |
| sum(x)                 | Sum                                               |
| min(x)                 | Minimum Value (x_min)                             |
| max(x)                 | Maximum Value (x_max)                             |
| range(x)               | x_min and x_max                                   |

### Further Useful Functions

**Print Function**

The `print()` function writes the output to the console or output file
(batch mode).

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
print(sqrt(2))
```

    ## [1] 1.414214

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
print(sqrt(2), digits = 4)
```

    ## [1] 1.414

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
print(sqrt(2) + 10, digits = 4)
```

    ## [1] 11.41

**Generation of a Vector**

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
c(2, 5, 7, 2, 6)
```

    ## [1] 2 5 7 2 6

Vectors can be called as you like: `vector = c(2,5,7,2,6)` or
`vector <- c(2,5,7,2,6)`

**Character Vectors**

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
text <- c("these are", "some strings")
text
```

    ## [1] "these are"    "some strings"

By using the `paste()` function we can merge character vectors:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
paste(text[1], text[2], sep = " ")
```

    ## [1] "these are some strings"

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Special case with sep = ""
abc <- c("a", "b", "c")
paste0(1:3, abc)
```

    ## [1] "1a" "2b" "3c"

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
first_name <- "Luke"
last_name <- "Skywalker"
paste("My name is", first_name, last_name, sep = " ")
```

    ## [1] "My name is Luke Skywalker"

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
number <- 9
# Although number is an integer, it becomes a character by using paste():
paste(number, "is an integer", sep = " ")
```

    ## [1] "9 is an integer"

**Generation of a Sequence**

`seq(from, to, by)`

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
seq(1, 5, 0.5)
```

    ## [1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0

**Colon Operator**

`:` generates a regular sequence (i.e., sequence in steps of one)

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
1:6
```

    ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6

**Repetition of X**

`rep(x, times, each)`

- times: the sequence is repeated n times

- each: each element is repeated n times

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
rep(1:6, times=2)
```

    ##  [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
rep(1:6, each=2)
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
rep(1:6, times=2, each=2)
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6

**Display of the n first elements of x**

`head(x, n = 6)`

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
x = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144)
```

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
head(x, n = 6)
```

    ## [1] 1 1 2 3 5 8

**Display of the n last elements of x**

`tail(x, n = 6)`

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
tail(x, n = 6)
```

    ## [1]  13  21  34  55  89 144

## R Variables

So far, we have not saved the results of our calculations. Of course, we
can define variables in R, and assign a value to them.

Variables are defined in R like this: `my_var <- 4`. `<-` here is a
special assignment arrow, and consists of a `<` character and a `-`.
There is a key combination `ALT` + `-` in RStudio for this. So here we
assign the value 4 to the new variable `my_var`.

However, it is also possible to assign a variable with `=` instead of
`<-` However, since `=` is also the symbol for the assignment of
arguments (for functions), misunderstandings can potentially arise here.
R purists therefore prefer to use `<-`.

**Variable Names**

A variable must have a name - this consists of `letters`, `numbers` and
the characters `_` and/or `.` A variable name must start with a letter
and must not contain spaces.

There are a few conventions to follow to make R code readable and
understandable - especially when sharing it with others. We recommend
using `snake_case` for naming, i.e., we separate words within a name
with an underscore: `my_var`.

If we have defined a variable:

``` {r}
my_var <- 9
```

we can display their value in the console:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
print(my_var)
```

    ## [1] 9

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# or simply

my_var
```

    ## [1] 9

Variables exist in the Global Environment, but only as long as the
current R session remains. If you restart R, these variables are no
longer present. Therefore you should always record what you have done in
an R script/notebook.

## Data Types

So far we have worked with vectors. These represent the fundamental data
type. All further data types build on this. Vectors themselves can be
divided into the following types:

- **Numeric Vectors**: These are what we have been dealing with so far.
  Numeric vectors are further divided into `integer` (whole numbers) and
  `double` (real numbers).

- **Character Vectors**: The elements of this type consist of characters
  surrounded by quotation marks (either `'` or `"` ), e.g. `'word'` or
  `"word"`.

- **Logical Vectors**: The elements of this type can take only 3 values:
  `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `NA`.

Vectors must consist of the same elements, i.e., we cannot mix `logical`
and `character` vectors. Vectors have 3 properties:

- Type: `typeof()`: What is it?

- Length: `length()`: How many elements?

- Attributes: `attributes()`: Additional information (metadata)

Vectors are created either with the `c()` (abbreviation for combine)
function, or with special functions like `seq()` or `rep()`.

### **Subsetting of Vectors**

We can select the individual elements of a vector with `[]` (this is
called `subsetting` in technical jargon):

``` {r}
# Numeric vectors consist of numbers. These are either natural numbers (integer) or real numbers (double).

numbers <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
```

In R the first element of a vector is addressed with index 1, in many other programming languages the first element of a collection (e.g., a vector) is addressed with index 0.
``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# First Element:
numbers[1]
```

    ## [1] 1

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Second Element:
numbers[2]
```

    ## [1] 2.5

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Third Element:
numbers[3]
```

    ## [1] 4.5

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Alternatively, the last element - here the third - can be identified by the length of the vector:
numbers[length(numbers)]
```

    ## [1] 4.5

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# With - (minus) we can omit an element, e.g., drop the first element and keep the rest:
numbers[-1]
```

    ## [1] 2.5 4.5

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# We can use a sequence, e.g., the first two elements:
numbers[1:2]
```

    ## [1] 1.0 2.5

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# We can omit the first and third element:
numbers[-c(1, 3)]
```

    ## [1] 2.5

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Or let us output only the elements that are greater than a threshold:
numbers[numbers>2]
```

    ## [1] 2.5 4.5

#### Matrices

As mentioned before, actually everything in R is a vector. A scalar is a
vector of length 1. A matrix is in principle also a vector, but one with
a `dim` (dimension) attribute:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
m <- matrix(1:8, nrow = 2, ncol = 4)
m
```

    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
    ## [1,]    1    3    5    7
    ## [2,]    2    4    6    8

There are two more functions we should get to know: `cbind()` and
`rbind()`. These are used to join vectors or matrices.

`cbind()` combines the columns (column-bind) of vectors/matrices to one
object:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
x1 <- 1:3
x1
```

    ## [1] 1 2 3

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
x2 <- 10:12
x2
```

    ## [1] 10 11 12

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
m1 <- cbind(x1, x2)
m1
```

    ##      x1 x2
    ## [1,]  1 10
    ## [2,]  2 11
    ## [3,]  3 12

This results in a matrix `m1` with the output vectors as columns.

`rbind()` combines the rows (row-bind) of vectors/ matrices to one
object:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
m2 <- rbind(x1, x2)
m2
```

    ##    [,1] [,2] [,3]
    ## x1    1    2    3
    ## x2   10   11   12

Matrices can also be indexed with `[]`. But we have to specify here
which row(s) and column(s) we want to get, using
`[rownumber, columnnumber]`.

#### Missing Values

Missing values are declared with `NA`.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
numbers <- c(12, 13, 15, 11, NA, 10)
numbers
```

    ## [1] 12 13 15 11 NA 10

The `is.na()` function can be used to test whether something is actually
a missing value:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
is.na(numbers)
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

The `na.omit()` function removes all incomplete cases of a data object.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
na.omit(numbers)
```

    ## [1] 12 13 15 11 10
    ## attr(,"na.action")
    ## [1] 5
    ## attr(,"class")
    ## [1] "omit"

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
#The output above consists of all cases that are not NA. However, the output also consists of additional information such as the positions of the deleted values and the class. If you want to get rid of these attributes, you can simply use the as.numeric function:

numbers_omit <- as.numeric(na.omit(numbers))
numbers_omit
```

    ## [1] 12 13 15 11 10

## Data Frames

Data Frames can be considered as the most important objects in R. Data
sets are represented in R by data frames. A data frame consists of rows
and columns and corresponds to a data set in SPSS.

Technically, a Data Frame is a list whose elements are equal-length
vectors. The vectors themselves can be `numeric`, `logical` or
`character` vectors, or also factors. A Data Frame is a 2-dimensional
structure, and can be indexed like a vector on the one hand (more
precisely: like a matrix), and like a list on the other hand.

Traditionally, Data Frames are defined in R with the function
`data.frame()`.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
trad_df <- data.frame(gender = c("male", "female", "male", "diverse", "female"), age = c(22, 45, 33, 27, 30), hometown = c("Goettingen", "Hannover", "Kassel", "Hannover", "Goettingen"))
trad_df
```

    ##    gender age  hometown
    ## 1    male  22 Goettingen
    ## 2  female  45 Hannover
    ## 3    male  33 Kassel
    ## 4 diverse  27 Hannover
    ## 5  female  30 Goettingen

You can do a lot with data frames, e.g., we will talk about the sub
setting in a moment. But already on such initially created data frames
we can apply some functions, among them the well-known `print()`
function to output the data frame, but also the `str()` function to
display the structure of the data frame or a statistical summary and
nature of the data by applying `summary()` function.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
print(trad_df)
```

    ##    gender age  hometown
    ## 1    male  22 Goettingen
    ## 2  female  45 Hannover
    ## 3    male  33 Kassel
    ## 4 diverse  27 Hannover
    ## 5  female  30 Goettingen

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
str(trad_df)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    5 obs. of  3 variables:
    ##  $ gender  : chr  "male" "female" "male" "diverse" ...
    ##  $ age     : num  22 45 33 27 30
    ##  $ hometown: chr  "Goettingen" "Hannover" "Kassel" "Hannover" ...

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
summary(trad_df)
```

    ##     gender               age         hometown        
    ##  Length:5           Min.   :22.0   Length:5

    ##                     Max.   :45.0

### Packages

Almost every software has extensions of some kind. Some have extensions,
some have plug-ins, some have add-ons. Different terminology for the
same principle: more features through other people’s extensions. In R,
such extensions are called *Packages*.

Packages provide additional functions that are not included in the base
R package. We first install a collection of packages for data
manipulation (`tidyr`, `dplyr`, `forcats`), for importing data files
(`readr`) and for graphics (`ggplot2`). These can all be installed
together with this command, which we enter in the console (remove the `#` before you execute the command):

``` {r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```

**This installation needs to run only once!**

After that we can load the packages like this:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

**You need to run this every time you open RStudio again!**

### Back to Data Frames

In the `tidyverse` package, data frames are recently also called
`tibbles` or `tbl`. tibbles `are` defined with the `tibble()` function,
and are just a modern variant of a data frame. They make working with
data sets easier.

A Data Frame is defined like this:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df <- tibble(gender = c("male", "female", "diverse", "male", "female"), age = c(22, 45, 33, 27, 30), hometown = c("Goettingen", "Hannover", "Kassel", "Hannover", "Goettingen"))

df
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 3
    ##   gender    age hometown 
    ##   <chr>   <dbl> <chr>    
    ## 1 male       22 Goettingen
    ## 2 female     45 Hannover
    ## 3 diverse    33 Kassel
    ## 4 male       27 Hannover
    ## 5 female     30 Goettingen

`df` is now a Data Frame with two variables, `gender` and `age`. In the
Environment section of RStudio, data frames appear under Data.

A data frame has the attributes `names()`, `colnames()` and
`rownames()`, where `names()` and `colnames()` mean the same thing.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
attributes(df)
```

    ## $class
    ## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
    ## 
    ## $row.names
    ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
    ## 
    ## $names
    ## [1] "gender"   "age"      "hometown"

The length of a Data Frame is the length of the list, i.e., it
corresponds to the number of columns. This can be queried with `ncol()`;
`nrow()` gives the number of rows.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
ncol(df)
```

    ## [1] 3

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
nrow(df)
```

    ## [1] 5

### Data Frame Subsetting

As mentioned above, a data frame can be indexed like a list, or like a
matrix.

- Like a list: the individual columns can be selected with `$`.

- Like a matrix: the elements can be selected with `[ ]`.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df$gender
```

    ## [1] "male"    "female"  "diverse" "male"    "female"

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df$age
```

    ## [1] 22 45 33 27 30

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df$hometown
```

    ## [1] "Goettingen" "Hannover" "Kassel" "Hannover" "Goettingen"

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df["gender"]
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 1
    ##   gender 
    ##   <chr>  
    ## 1 male   
    ## 2 female 
    ## 3 diverse
    ## 4 male   
    ## 5 female

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df["age"]
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 1
    ##     age
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1    22
    ## 2    45
    ## 3    33
    ## 4    27
    ## 5    30

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df["hometown"]
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 1
    ##   hometown 
    ##   <chr>    
    ## 1 Goettingen
    ## 2 Hannover
    ## 3 Kassel
    ## 4 Hannover
    ## 5 Goettingen

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Select by position
df[1]
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 1
    ##   gender 
    ##   <chr>  
    ## 1 male   
    ## 2 female 
    ## 3 diverse
    ## 4 male   
    ## 5 female

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df[2]
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 1
    ##     age
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1    22
    ## 2    45
    ## 3    33
    ## 4    27
    ## 5    30

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df[3]
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 1
    ##   hometown 
    ##   <chr>    
    ## 1 Goettingen
    ## 2 Hannover
    ## 3 Kassel
    ## 4 Hannover
    ## 5 Goettingen

Similar to matrices, rows and columns can be selected, again with
`[row number, column number]`.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# First row, first column
df[1, 1]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   gender
    ##   <chr> 
    ## 1 male

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# First row, all columns
df[1, ]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   gender   age hometown 
    ##   <chr>  <dbl> <chr>    
    ## 1 male      22 Goettingen

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# All rows, first column
df[, 1]
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 1
    ##   gender 
    ##   <chr>  
    ## 1 male   
    ## 2 female 
    ## 3 diverse
    ## 4 male   
    ## 5 female

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Also, we can use sequences
# First three rows, all columns
df[1:3, ]
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   gender    age hometown 
    ##   <chr>   <dbl> <chr>    
    ## 1 male       22 Goettingen
    ## 2 female     45 Hannover
    ## 3 diverse    33 Kassel

Since the columns are vectors, we can also index them:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
df$gender[1]
```

    ## [1] "male"

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# or

df$age[2:3]
```

    ## [1] 45 33

## Pipe Operator

We’ve already noticed that code can quickly become cluttered when we
perform a sequence of operations. This leads to nested function calls.

Example: We have a numerical vector of n = 10 measured values (generated
here for training purposes with `rnorm()` from normally distributed
random numbers) and want to center these first, then calculate the
standard deviation, and finally round to two decimal places.

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
set.seed(1283)
random_sample <- rnorm(10, 24, 5)
random_sample
```

    ##  [1] 24.74984 21.91726 23.98551 19.63019 23.96428 22.83092 18.86240 19.08125
    ##  [9] 23.76589 21.88846

We can perform the desired calculation of the rounded standard deviation
of the centered values as nested function calls:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
round(sd(scale(random_sample,
               center = TRUE, 
               scale = FALSE)), 
      digits = 2)
```

    ## [1] 2.19

The `scale()`, `sd()` and `round()` functions are now executed in
sequence (from the inside out), in such a way that the output of one
function is passed as input to the next function.

The `scale()` and `round()` functions have additional arguments:
`center = TRUE`, `scale = FALSE`, and `digits = 2`, respectively. This
is efficient, but leads to code that is difficult to read.

An alternative to this would be to store the intermediate steps as
variables:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
random_sample_z <- scale(random_sample, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)

sd_random_sample_z <- sd(random_sample_z)

sd_random_sample_z_rounded <- round(sd_random_sample_z, digits = 2)

sd_random_sample_z_rounded
```

    ## [1] 2.19

This way, each of the substeps is on a separate line and we understand
the code without any problems. However, this method requires us to
define two variables that we don’t actually need.

But there is a very elegant method to call functions one after the other
without having to write them nested: we use the `pipe` operator which looks like this `%>%` and is
provided by the package `dplyr`:

``` {r}
library(dplyr)
```

`%>%` is defined as an *Infix* operator. This means that it stands
*between two* objects, similar to a mathematical operator. The name
`pipe` is to be understood in the way that we “pass” or “pass on” an
object to a function.

This `pipe` operator is used so often that it already has its own key
combination: `Cmd`+`Shift`+`M` (macOS) or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`M` (Windows
and Linux).

Our example from above:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
round(sd(scale(random_sample,
               center = TRUE,
               scale = FALSE)),
      digits = 2)
```

    ## [1] 2.19

with the `%>%` operator turns into:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
random_sample %>%
    scale(center = TRUE, scale = FALSE) %>%
    sd() %>%
    round(digits = 2)
```

    ## [1] 2.19

This code is to be read like this:

1.  We start with the object `random_sample` and pass it with `%>%` as
    argument to the function `scale()`

2.  We apply scale(), with the additional arguments `center = TRUE`,
    `scale = FALSE` to it, and pass the output as an argument to the
    function `sd()`

3.  We apply `sd()` (without further arguments) and pass the output as
    argument to `round()`

4.  `round()`, with the further argument `digits = 2`, is executed.
    Since no further `pipe` follows, the output is written to the
    console.

So it is clear: if we want to use the result further, we have to assign
it to a variable:

``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
sd_random_sample_z_rounded <- random_sample %>% 
  scale(center = TRUE, scale = FALSE) %>% 
  sd() %>% 
  round(digits = 2)

sd_random_sample_z_rounded
```

    ## [1] 2.19

So we pass an object to a function with `%>%`. If we do not specify
anything else, this object is the first argument of the function.
